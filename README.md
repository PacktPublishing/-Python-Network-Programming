## About the Video Course
Python has become one of the most popular programming languages. This video uses a project-based approach to teach you how to leverage this easy-to-learn language for network automation tasks. The main goal of this course is to help you master key concepts in Python with the aid of interesting projects. You will learn to create exciting Python apps to automate daily networking tasks such as configuring devices, collecting information about the network, testing by client simulations, or network discovery. This course will help you build some mesmerizing network tools with Python, including a Subnet calculator; configuring multiple network devices concurrently via SSH or Telnet; a DHCP client simulator for testing a DHCP server in the local network; network discovery via SNMP; OS fingerprinting; and network attacks via Scapy. This tutorial uses real-life scenarios and use cases to help you build network automation tools with the amazing Python language. By the end of this course, you will be able to take your Python programming skills to the next level for network automation.
